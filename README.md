# Task-8
# Decision Tree – Bank Marketing Subscription Prediction

## Objective
To build a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing data.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded Bank Marketing dataset
2. Inspected data structure
3. Handled unknown categorical values
4. Encoded categorical features
5. Split dataset into training and testing sets
6. Trained Decision Tree classifier with limited depth
7. Visualized Decision Tree
8. Evaluated model using classification report
9. Compared train and test accuracy
10. Interpreted decision rules

## Evaluation
- Classification Report
- Training vs Testing Accuracy
- Tree Visualization

## Key Decision Rules
- Longer call duration increases chance of subscription
- Successful previous campaigns improve outcomes
- Fewer campaign contacts lead to better response

## Interview Questions Covered
- Why Decision Trees overfit?
- What is max_depth?
- What is Gini Impurity?
- What is pruning?
- What is decision boundary?

## Final Outcome
This task demonstrates interpretable machine learning using Decision Trees and rule-based predictions.
